	<h1>What is Amraelia?</h1>
	<p>Amraelia is the beautiful world that we, Amraelians, live in. Together with monties, we adapt to the beautiful place that we inhabit! Everyone of us has a goal! None slack off to further improve the quality and modernize Amraelia.</p>
	<h2>Who's giving me this information?</h2>
	<p>I'm the creator of the monsturer—Mentro Karst—and my plan is to spread the word of Amraelia and help amraelians with their journey and path. The monsturer is a device created to capture and manage your monsties with one click!</p>
	<p>For many years, I was helping with the architecture of Stelazis, the capital region and the best point to start out in! At the time I started, I was 15 years old. Back then, the place was a mess, trust me!</p>
	<p>A lot has changed the next 25 years. Good things. People had their homes, well-fed families and had the motivation to raise a monsty! And that, I always say, is dedication.</p>
	<h2>How can I get there?</h2>
	<p>To get to Amraelia, all you need to do is to follow <a href="./downloads.html">this link!</a>. It will show you all the information you need to know to arrive there.</p>
