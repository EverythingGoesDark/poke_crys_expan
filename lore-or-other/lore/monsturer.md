The creatures in this world are called __monsties__ (*singular monsty*).
Monsties inhabit the entire world of Amraelia. There's entire ecosystems full of them. On Mountains, in waters, deep in forests, in deserts, they're even filling the sky!

For many, many centuries, the people of Amraelia tried tamed these monsties, be it for befriending or trapping and using them. But the future held more potential, and so, normally taming and manually capturing them became tedious. It was a future of automation, where people used technology to the benefit of making things easier.

And there was a specific someone that took advantage of future technology; that was Mentro Karst. He found a way to get easier, better capturing methods by simply one click on your wrist. This was an entirely new era. The era of the monsturer (monsty + capturer). 

While it's very expensive to buy and then count the money spent on the digital capture function in, people, both poor and rich, had bought it in masses! It was an easy way to get wealthy and rich, while the others had their automation and forgot how to do things manually. It's the way of automation, and it is what it is. Some people are against it. Some aren't bothered. Some actively fight back. Some can't afford it. But the point stands. The world slowly transitions because of such choices. 

# How the monsturer works in battle:

***

1. You open the display of your monsturer [press start]. It shows many informations — including the current monsty and opposing monsty in the field, shows the general information in the Amraegister.

2. The second menu when you swipe left [press the right arrow key] shows your capture methods.
    1. If you dont have any capture method, you can easily buy one directly online by pressing the dedicated "buy" button [press select]. Prices depend on strength, type and development stage. 
	1. If you chose your type [hover on option], select it and choose your CTS (capture type strategy).
    There are three CTS:
        - Chaotic: A gamble. It's still experimental and can have various unexpected outcomes. Sometimes effective, sometimes not. A method for the reckless, but a quick one nonetheless. Scales with a multiplier.
		- Testing: Not recommended for capturing, but to get general information about a monsty and the best way to approach. Used by researchers. Guaranteed to work.
		- Solid: Called "defensive" by most. It stays in the middle of things and works better depending on the monsties own defense and strength. Works best later. No multiplier. 

3. When everything is chosen, you can aim the monsturers pointer on the target [choose which to capture].

4. Soon enough, a new screen is seen. This lets you confirm whether you're actually sure to continue, or cancel. [by pressing B]

5. By holding the screen (hold a), the target gets dragged to the ground and slowly gets moved into the monsturer untill the process is complete. Below is a list of potential outcomes and what to watch out for: 
	1. The progress can easily be interrupted by releasing the button, the monsty defending itself or by distractions. This WASTES a capture method. 
	1. Before the process of capturing starts, the target gets scanned. If it is already inside someone elses possession, it is already signed into the database and thus will interrupt the process. This WASTES a capture method.
	1. WARNING: Do NOT point the monsturer at a person or an object! This WILL HARM the person and potentially DESTROY the monsturer.
	1. When in testing mode, the process is quicker and only scans the monsty. This, however, also wastes a capture method.
	1. When in solid mode, it will always waste a capture method, no matter if it worked or not.
	1. When in chaotic mode, it has a chance to keep the capture method, whether or not it has worked. Chance scales with the multiplier.

6. When successfully captured, the monsty officially belongs to you and gets registered into the IMD (international monsty database). You may release the button then.
