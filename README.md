# poke_crys_expan
This project will take a while to even get started on, as I will first collect ideas and concepts.

Anyone willing to help, contribute or work alonside with me will please contact me with my active E-mail address (cburkandt10.gmx.de) or on discord (imrealyourenot)



Anything done before the 3rd February in 2026 is bound to change as for now, I am limited to use my phone.




This Pokémom fangame will have gen 2 / pokemon gold,silver,crystal aesthetics and limitations from the gameboy color. What I mean is not the RAM limit or imitating the PPU (not yet).

The limitations will be listed below. If you want to help me, see these as rules or a guidance of what you can do:
  - the game will be made in a 20:18 aspect ratio, a 160x144px screen, or a map of 10x9 tiles
  - a whole tile is 16x16 pixels
  - a sprite should be 8x16, 16x16 or 8x8 pixels, for the 8x16 and 8x8 its important to get an entire tile full.
  - soundtracks will be made with a max of 4 sound channels (channel 1+2, pulse, main tracks ; channel 3, wave, followup, beat; channel 4, noise, sfx, drums)

This is basically for if you want to work alongside me and are active, but if you have suggestions and ideas, feel free to use your owm style!

While there are limitations and the likes, this will be by no means a QOL improvement hack. The game will be made entirely from scratch, and I am planning to add quite a few characters and mechanics that Pokemom crystal doesnt have.

Features include (highest priority- lowest priority)

1. You get to choose between more than two characters. Not only do they visually look different; they also have their own unique abilities, story-line and starters!

2. An entire world to explore. No, not just a single region. Atleast 16 regions will be added, and (there might even be some secrets later on...)

3. Custom-made sprites and maps will be made to give the game its owm feel, however they are going to take inspiration from pokemom crystal.

4. New fakemon, key items, or evolutions to existing Pokemom will be added, aswell as starters having a unique mechanic, appearance or moveset, or maybe even all the three!

5. the battle engine will be made as modern as possible, but at developement stage, this might stall.

6. an overhaul to the old menu, aswell as player customization

7. an owm intro playing before the title screen



I cant promise that everything will work as planned, or that the game will be playable after a short amount of time. What i can say, is, that I always had the dream to create my own Pokemon fangame, and whatever works, I will try to do.


The story isnt fleshed out as I dont yet have everything prepared andhavent collected many ideas for characters, Pokemon etc. Once I am ready to create on my computer, its likely I will be able to give more information.

I will add a tiny collection of things I have gathered for now, though!

Im so sorry the sprites look so blurry, I will change that when my environment is back
